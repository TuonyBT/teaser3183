Consider two intersecting discs, each of apparent radius r = 50.
The chord between the two points where their circumferences cross subtends an angle theta at the centre of each circle.
This chord has length 2h, and the centres of the circles are 2d apart.
In a given circle, therefore, a triangle is formed from the centre and the two points of intersection, with vertical height d, base length 2h and the other side lengths each r

In A's statement, the magnitude is the ratio of the total part of the diameter (2r) which is obscured (2*(r-d)), which must be a whole number. Therefore d must be a whole number.
In B's statement, the first component refers to the amount of the circumference (r*theta) multiplied by the radius, i.e. theta * r^2
                  the second component refers to the area of the two segments created by the chord.
                  The area of a segment is the difference between the area of the corresponding sector (1 / 2 * theta * r^2) and the triangle described above. This equates to
                  2* (1 / 2 * theta * r^2 - d * h)

Therefore B's statement can be expressed as theta * r^2 - 2* (1 / 2 * theta * r^2 - d * h) is a whole number
The terms in theta cancel, so we end up with d * h is a whole number, so if d is a whole number, so must be h
Given that r = 50, and d, h and r make up a right-angled triangle, our solution stems from Pythagorean triplets for hypotenuse r.
C's statement limits us to cases where magnitude = 2(r - d) > 10, so we just find all solutions for which d > 5.
